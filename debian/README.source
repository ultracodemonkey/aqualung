This package uses dpatch to manage all modifications to the upstream
source. Changes are stored in the source package as diffs in
debian/patches and applied during the build. Please see:

/usr/share/doc/dpatch/README.source.gz

for more information on how to apply the patches, modify patches, or
remove a patch.
